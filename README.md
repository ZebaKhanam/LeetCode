# LeetCode

I wanted to take up a challenge of coding Leetcode problems for 30 days. 
Let us see where this journey will take me.

Day 1: 30th August
On Day 1, I was able to solve three easy question. The language I have used is Python3.

1. Problem: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Approach: Brute Force
The most logical and basic idea is to compare the sum of all the posible combinations with target. However, the time complexity is O(n2). 

1 Approach: One pass
 Search if the difference of target with number from first iteration exists. The built in functions of python decease the run time. However, this is not the optimal solution.
 
2 Approach: Hash Maps



2. Problem: Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

Approach:


3. Problem Roman Numeral to Integer Problem
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Approach:

Day 2: 

1. Problem: Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Day 3:
Problem: Valid Parentheses
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
