# LeetCode
I never thought there will be time in my life I would fall out of love for coding. Coding was my first love from my early school days. To fall in love again, I decided to start from fresh.
I wanted to take up a challenge of coding Leetcode problems for 30 days. 
Let us see where this journey will take me.

1. Day 1: 30th August
On Day 1, I was able to solve three easy question. The language I have used is Python3.

1. Problem: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Approach: Brute Force

2. Problem: Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
